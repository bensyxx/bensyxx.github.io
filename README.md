I recently migrated my website's host from [Replit](https://replit.com) to GitHub. If you are looking for my site, [click here](https://bensyxx.dev) or go to [https://bensyxx.dev](https://bensyxx.dev).

> NOTE: I have a CDN on GitHub too because I am horrible at PHP and can't handle web requests. Just enter a pull request with whatever you want to upload on it. [CDN repo](https://github.com/bensyxx/cdn)
